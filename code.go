 #2: The maximum number of days to wait for a response from a given deadline. This problem is similar to the problem we solved in Problem #1, but with a deadline for the task.
Here's an example implementation of the `PalindromeLeeT` class that implements the solution to Problem #2:
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand"
    "time"
)

type PalindromeLeeT struct {
    deadline time.Time
}

func (p *PalindromeLeeT) Run() {
    // Generate a random number between 1 and 10
    randomNumber := rand.Intn(10) + 1
    
    // Generate the number of days before the deadline for this palindrome
    deadline := time.Now
