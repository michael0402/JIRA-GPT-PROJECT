 with new feature
Here's an example of how you could implement a bug fix with a new feature in Java:
```
public class BugFixWithNewFeature {
    private int bug;

    public BugFixWithNewFeature(int bug) {
        this.bug = bug;
    }

    public void fixBug() {
        // Fix the bug
    }

    public void addFeature() {
        // Add a new feature
    }
}
```
In this example, the `BugFixWithNewFeature` class has two private instance variables: `bug` and `feature`. The `bug` variable is used to store the bug number that the class is intended to fix. The `feature` variable is used to store the new feature that the class is
