 using Dijkstra's algorithm.
Here's an example of the shortest path algorithm in JavaScript using Dijkstra's algorithm:
```javascript
function dijkstra(graph, start, end, weightFunc) {
  let shortestDistance = Infinity;
  let shortestDistanceCmp = Infinity;

  // Loop through all nodes in the graph
  for (let node in graph) {
    // If the node is not already the start node
    if (node !== start) {
      // If the node is not already in the shortest distance table
      if (graph[node] === undefined) {
        // If the node is not already in the distance table
        if (shortestDistanceCmp === Infinity) {
          // If there is no distance
